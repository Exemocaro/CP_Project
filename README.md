This is the project we made for the Parallel Computing Class at UMinho.

We were given some source code taken from [FoleyLab's MolecularDynamics Repo](https://github.com/FoleyLab/MolecularDynamics "Molecular Dynamics"), and we applied a variety of techniques in order to optimize the code and generally make it faster.

Some of the techniques used range from simple code simplification and dependency removals, to code vectorization, OpenMP and MPI, among others. In the end, we achieved a 99% in the execution time of this code.
